MIXI researcher Matt Curinga and graduate researcher Jacob Geier presented at [NYC Open Data Week 2024](https://2024.open-data.nyc/event/mapping-open-school-and-census-data-in-new-york-city/). They shared their recent work, in collaboration Liz de Freitas, exploring New York City schools, with a focus on school and City demographics at the level of school buildings and neighborhoods. Free Open Source Software python library, “[nycschools](https://adelphi-ed-tech.github.io/nycschools/intro.html)”, which makes it easier to work with and analyze open data regarding New York City Public Schools, including geospatial data.

Video of the talk coming soon, on the [BetaNYC YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@betanyc/videos).
