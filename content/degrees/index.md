The Masterâ€™s in STEAM Teaching and Learning prepares students for 
careers in mathematics education, science education or computer 
science education, with accreditation for K-12 teaching in their 
discipline.
</p>

<p>
The program emphasizes interdisciplinary learning experiences and 
creativity. The term STEAM refers to Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Art, and Math. STEAM represents an approach to STEM education that 
prioritizes creativity, design, reasoning, innovation, making, and 
technology, with a focus on teaching and learning in formal and informal 
learning environments.

We have <b>NOYCE fellowships</b> available to cover student tuition. Contact Dr. 
Tracy Hogan at <a class="fw-bold" href="mailto:hogan@adelphi.edu">hogan@adelphi.edu</a>

</p>

<p>
This program equips students with skills for developing project-based 
curricula and engaging pedagogy, guided by research indicating that the 
STEAM approach can help students who have been excluded from math, science, 
and computer science academically and professionally. The program supports 
students to become effective and passionate teachers who can design robust 
project-based curriculum, connect across school communities, and inspire 
their students to think rigorously and creatively about mathematics, science, 
and computer science.
</p>

<p>
The program offers courses online and in-person, allowing candidates to 
take courses at night. The program can be completed in one year and 
includes 30 credits of coursework and a teaching practicum. Candidates 
benefit from our collaborative partnerships with school districts, our 
exceptional mentor teachers in the field, and opportunities to join projects 
and events hosted by MIXI, our Manhattan Institute for Studies of STEM and 
the Imagination.
