    <p class="fs-5">
Founded in 2020, the MIXI Institute for STEM and the Imagination is housed at the Adelphi University 
Brooklyn Center. The Institute provides an open space for transdisciplinary collaboration and 
innovation in response to rapidly changing social and material conditions of contemporary life. We 
pursue novel theoretical and methodological approaches to the social sciences, drawing on fields such 
as speculative philosophy, affective computing, science and technology studies, sensory ethnography, 
immersive arts and media, adaptive architecture, sensor technologies, and critical life studies. Our 
combined focus on the biosocialities of learning and behaviour is underpinned by a rigorous 
commitment to bio-ethics that is responsive to social, technological, and environmental change.
